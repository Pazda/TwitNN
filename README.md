Reads a given amount of tweets from a specific username and trains a model to generate more tweets as if they were from that user. Still in early progress as of 1/24/19

For a casual personal learning project, messy code warning!!

## Dependencies:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- textgenrnn by minimaxir

## Planned:
- User input for username, epochs, temperature, number of tweets
- If this user has a model for a specific username, use that unless they specify otherwise. Don't use others'
- Create webpage so users can interact with this easily (and to learn some web dev)
